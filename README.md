It focuses on:

- **lightness**: native, displays only the device screen
- **performance**: 30~120fps, depending on the device
- **quality**: 1920×1080 or above
- **low latency**: 35~70ms
- **low startup time**: ~1 second to display the first image
- **non-intrusiveness**: nothing is left installed on the Android device
- **user benefits**: no account, no ads, no internet required
- **freedom**: free and open source software

Its features include:

- audio forwarding (Android >= 11)
- recording
- mirroring with Android device screen off
- copy-paste in both directions
- configurable quality
- Android device screen as a webcam (V4L2) (Linux-only)
- physical keyboard/mouse simulation (HID)
- OTG mode
- and more…

# Prerequisites
The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Audio forwarding is supported for API >= 30 (Android 11+).

Make sure you `enabled USB debugging on your device(s)`.

On some devices, you also need to enable an additional option `USB debugging (Security Settings)` (this is an item different from USB debugging) to control it using a keyboard and mouse. Rebooting the device is necessary once this option is set.

Note that `USB debugging` is not required to run scrcpy in OTG mode.
